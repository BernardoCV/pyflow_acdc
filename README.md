## Installation

### Basic Installation

Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install pyflow-acdc
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.9 or higher

### For Users
To run examples, download the folder to your repository including the csv folders.

### For Developers
#### Initial Setup
1. Install Git if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install git
   # For Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BernardoCV/pyflow_acdc.git
cd pyflow_acdc
```

3. Install in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
This installs the package in "editable" mode, allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.

#### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
git push origin new-branch-name
```

2. To push your changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git pull origin new-branch-name
git push origin new-branch-name
```

3. To pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

To merge your changes into the main branch please contact the repository owner.

### Optional Dependencies

You can install pyflow_acdc with optional dependencies using pip:

```bash
# Install with all optional dependencies
pip install pyflow-acdc[All]

# Or install specific optional dependency groups:
pip install pyflow-acdc[mapping]      # For mapping features (folium, branca)
pip install pyflow-acdc[OPF]          # For optimal power flow (pyomo)
pip install pyflow-acdc[Dash]         # For Dash web applications
pip install pyflow-acdc[Array_OPT]    # For array optimization (ortools, pyomo)
pip install pyflow-acdc[TEP_pymoo]    # For TEP with pymoo (pymoo, pyomo)
pip install pyflow-acdc[Gurobi]       # For Gurobi solver (requires license)
pip install pyflow-acdc[plotting]     # For static image export (kaleido)
```

Or install individual packages manually:

**For mapping:**
```bash
pip install folium branca
```

**For OPF:**
```bash
pip install pyomo
conda install -c conda-forge ipopt
```

**For Array Optimization:**
```bash
pip install ortools pyomo
pip install highs  # Optional: for HiGHS solver
```

**For TEP with pymoo:** (still in development)
```bash
pip install pymoo pyomo
```
**Note:** Both `pymoo` (for outer optimization) and `pyomo` (for inner OPF subproblems) are required.

**For static image export (plotly):**
```bash
pip install kaleido
```

pyflow_acdc has callback capabilities and has been tested with the following pyomo linked solvers:

```bash

ipopt
conda install -c conda-forge ipopt

highs
pip install highs

gurobi (requires external licensing)
pip install gurobipy


glpk
pip install glpk

cbc
conda install -c conda-forge coincbc

bonmin
conda install -c conda-forge coin-or-bonmin



```


**Note:** `ipopt` and `bonmin` are not available on PyPI and must be installed via conda-forge.

**For Bonmin (Linux only):**
```bash
# First install system package:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install coinor-libbonmin-dev

# Then install Python interface:
conda install -c conda-forge coin-or-bonmin
```

**For Dash:**
```bash
pip install dash
```
## Test

Run the test suite:
```bash
pyflow-acdc-test
```

**Test Flags:**
```bash
--quick         # Quick tests only
--tep           # TEP tests only
--show-output    # All tests with output
```
## Documentation
Online documentation can be found at:

https://pyflow-acdc.readthedocs.io/

To build the latest documentation of a branch, build it locally.

To build the documentation:
```bash
cd docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```

**Note:** On Windows, you may need to use `make.bat html` or install `make` (e.g., via Chocolatey or WSL).

The documentation will be available in `docs/_build/html/index.html`
